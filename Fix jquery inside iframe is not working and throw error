//That error means that jQuery has not yet loaded on the page. Using $(document).ready(...) or any variant thereof will do no good, as $ is the jQuery function.
//Using window.onload should work here. Note that only one function can be assigned to window.onload. To avoid losing the original onload logic, you can decorate the original function like so:

originalOnload = window.onload;
window.onload = function() {
  if (originalOnload) {
    originalOnload();
  }
  // YOUR JQUERY
};
This will execute the function that was originally assigned to window.onload, and then will execute // YOUR JQUERY.
